            <h5>Jehangir Kothari Parade is a promenade built on land bequeathed by Seth Jehangir Hormusji Kothari to the city of Karachi.<br/>
              It is situated in the Clifton.<br/>
              There are two structures: the Promenade Pavilion and the Pier of the complex which is named after Lady Lloyd, Governor of Bombay Sir George Lloyd's wife.<br/>
              This is evident in the marble plaque embedded in the pier wall that reads, "Lady Lloyd Pier".<br/>
              In June 2005, City District Government Karachi (CDGK) started extensive renovation work of the promenade pier and pavilion. <br/>
              The project covered more area on both sides of Lady Lloyd Pier and after some delays, the project was finally inaugurated on February 27, 2007The finished project became Pakistan's largest park.<br/>
              It was constructed on 130 acres of land around the pier and the newly formed park was named as Bagh Ibne Qasim in memory of the 8th century Muslim conqueror Muhammad Bin Qasim.<br/>
              The park consists of extensive lighting, pathways and lush green spaces.</h5>

              The mausoleum completed in the 1960s, is an iconic symbol of Karachi throughout the world.<br/>
              It is one of the most popular tourist destinations among foreign visitors to Karachi.<br/>
              The Mausoleum building was designed by famous architect Yahya Merchant.<br/>
              It is made of white marble with curved Moorish arches and copper grills reset on an elevated 54-square-meter platform.<br/>
              The cool inner sanctum reflects the green of a four-tiered crystal chandelier gifted by the People's Republic of China.<br/>
              Around the mausoleum is a park fitted with strong beamed spot-lights which at night project light on the white mausoleum</h5>

              It is said to have the largest mosque courtyard in the world for outdoor prayers.<br/>
              The amazing symmetry of the three giant white marble domes that cap the numerous arches is a marvel of architecture, and the numerous other huge domes and minarets are striking from a distance.<br/>
              The marble domes cover seven prayer chambers. <br/>
              Four lofty minarets stand at the four corners of the mosque, each with an outer circumference of 20 metres, soaring up to 54 meters.<br/>
