A simple website for HTML, CSS and Javascript beginners.

It was first project as a beginner and it was very helpful for me in learning.

Jssor plugin is used for home page slider, carousels and gallery
(<https://www.jssor.com/>). It is a fully responsive plugin and you can
customize it according to your requirements.

The Web site is created based on the following requirements.

-   The Home Page should be created making use of Frames with a suitable logo

-   The site should display a menu which will contain the options for brief
    introduction about the various products available, location of the shop and
    any other information if required.

-   The information should be categorized according to different type of
    products like if a User wants to see only ‘Beach Tours’ then he click on a
    Link/button/menu etc and he will see different type of Beach Tours.
    Similarly for ‘Hill Stations’, ‘Forts/Palaces’ and other products

-   When a user selects any product type, a list of products for that product
    type will be displayed.

-   Itinerary of individual tour products should be displayed on the Web Page
    along with the title but detailed itinerary should be stored in Individual
    Word documents which can be downloaded or viewed by the User who wishes to
    see the same.
